![Me in the Adidas Originals Store in Harajuku]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/blog-images/DSC_1266-2.jpg)

A bunch of my Media Design pals and I just landed in Tokyo. We're here for 13 days, before heading to Bangkok to spend four weeks in the Creative Media Design program at Stamford University.

We headed straight to Cat Street to grab some coffee at [The Roastery](http://www.tokyoeats.jp/the-roastery-by-nozy-coffee/) before exploring the vintage clothes shops and boutiques scattered around Harajuku. I spent way too much time in the Adidas Originals store. I regret nothing.

We also met our lecturer from Bangkok, Ajarn Wari. He took us through one of the assignments we are to complete while in Japan, a photographic series documenting things that are different to our culture back in Australia. After spending the day easily traversing Tokyo on public transport, with nothing more than some small pointers from Google Maps, I decided to spend some time studying signage in Japanese train stations. It had helped our group of 10 haphazard foreigners get around Tokyo pretty easily, presenting pretty complex information in a way that even we could understand.

Thus begins Tokyo Trains! I'll be taking some photos while i'm in Tokyo, and editing them as I go. This blog will serve to document my progress, and process, to deliver my final goal: an exhibition of my photography.
