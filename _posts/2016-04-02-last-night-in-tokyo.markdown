#### Reassurance found on the floor of a donut shop.


<p>Tonight is our last night in Tokyo. It's been an incredible trip, and i'm ready to get on the plane tomorrow morning and have a rest. I'm completely exhausted, and can't wait to relax for a few days and recuperate. On the flip side though, i'm a bit nervous about how much work we have to get done while there, and how little time we actually have available to us. We only have four weeks to complete countless assignments, and have a week long national public holiday right in the middle where productivity will be low.</p>
