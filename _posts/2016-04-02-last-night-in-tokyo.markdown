#### Reassurance found on the floor of a donut shop.


Since we arrived in Tokyo, our days have been a whirlwind of museums, exhibitions, strange food, and commuting. We've crammed so much in that it feels like we've been here for months! We're starting to push out of our comfort zones, and find stranger and more beautiful things. This was the view from the packaging design exhibition we visited at the Tokyo Midtown Design Hub today. I'm really enjoying Tokyo, but can't wait to get to Bangkok and be able to start putting this photography series together. Today I took my 500th photo of a train station, and i'm getting eager to move on to the next stage in the process.
