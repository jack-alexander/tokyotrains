![Test Shots in the Train Stations]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/blog-images/DSC_1746.jpg)

We've been catching plenty of trainsave been exploring Tokyo which has given me plenty of oppurtunites to grab some test shots in some of the stations. I took a bunch of photos today, but aren't completely happy with the composition. I'd really like them to be more vibrant and have higher contrast. I've found it really comfortable taking photos in public. I guess the cultural divide means that i'm not really worrying about being judged by the people walking past, which makes it easier to get into awkward positions to get the photo just right.

I'm using the [Nikon J5 mirrorless camera](http://www.nikon.com.au/en_AU/product/nikon-1/nikon1-j5) for the series. It's lightweight and really small, which makes it easy to carry around all day. It also takes 21-megapixel images in RAW, so I have heaps of flexibility with editing. A larger DSLR would allow me to get better image quality, but at the cost of probably not having the camera with me all of the time. Life in Japan is so fast paced that the perfect shot may only be there for a few seconds. Having a tiny camera that is around my neck all day meant that it was always within reach, and I barely ever missed a shot.
