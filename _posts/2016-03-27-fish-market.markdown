#### The greatest seafood i've ever eaten.

<article>

We left our little hotel in Kamata this morning at 6am to catch 3 trains to the fish markets. The markets we visted are the biggest in Tokyo, and bring in a massive amount of people every day, from restuaranters looking for the freshest ingredients, tourists wanting the best sushi in Tokyo, and fishermen looking for work.

It was amazing to see that even at 6am, the trains were running at full capacity. There seems to be no shortage of people to fill the carriages, no matter the direction they're headed, or the time of day. It's impressive, shocking and exhausting.
